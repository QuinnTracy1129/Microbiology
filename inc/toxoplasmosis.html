  Would you believe that 30-60% of people on the planet have been infected by a parasite and most never even know it? In this lesson, we will examine the disease toxoplasmosis and its causative agent, Toxoplasma gondii.

<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Cats and Pregnancy</h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  One of the precautions given to expectant mothers is that they absolutely cannot clean out a cat litter box. When I was younger, I used to think that it was a fringe benefit to being pregnant, an excuse for Mom to take it easy and not have to work so much. In reality, that litter box could house a potentially devastating illness that pregnant women are especially susceptible to.

<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Toxoplasma Gondii</h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  The disease-causing organism that sweet little Whiskers carried into the house and deposited in the litter box is <b>Toxoplasma gondii</b>. <i>T. gondii</i> is a single-celled coccidian parasite that causes toxoplasmosis in humans. It is estimated that 30% to 60% of people will test positive for T. gondii even though most of them never showed any clinical signs of the infection or are even aware that they have been exposed. The only symptoms are usually a mild fever and swollen <b>lymph nodes</b>. You would probably guess you had a mild flu and forget about it in a couple of days.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  Believe it or not, parasitology experts consider <i>T. gondii</i> to be the most common parasite infecting humans and other warm-blooded vertebrates but one of the rarest when it comes to causing actual disease.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  <i>T. gondii</i> is an intracellular parasite. When it comes in contact with a host cell, it attaches to the cell membrane, makes a small ring-like structure and pulls the membrane up over itself. Just imagine pulling a sock on over your foot. Muscle and nerve cells are common tissues infected but any cell is fair game (with the somewhat odd exception of erythrocytes).
</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Life Cycle</h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  Let's dive a little deeper into the life cycle of <i>T. gondii</i>. We'll start our discussion with a cat, the definitive host of <i>T. gondii</i>. The <b>definitive host</b> is simply the organism that houses the adult, sexually mature form of the parasite. Let's say our cat has ingested a <i>T. gondii</i> <b>cyst</b>, or a resistant form. The cyst passes into the small intestine and ruptures. The larval <b>tachyzoites</b>, or the rapidly dividing stage, emerge and invade the cat's tissues via the bloodstream, seeming to prefer the lungs and eyes. They mature rapidly, then reproduce sexually, resulting in <b>oocyst</b> production. Oocysts house the immature, developing parasite, a little like an egg. The cat will shed the oocysts in its feces for only one to two weeks during the lifetime of the cat and only after the first infection with <i>T. gondii</i>.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  The shed oocysts are not capable of producing illness for at least 24 hours and sometimes as long as five days. If an active oocyst is eaten by an unexposed cat, the parasite can mature and reproduce. If the oocyst is eaten by another animal, like a mouse or human, another cycle begins. The mouse, for example, is an <b>intermediate host</b>, which houses the immature, asexual stage of the parasite. In this case, <b>bradyzoites</b>, or the slowly dividing stage, will release into the intestine and spread to body tissues while remaining immature. A cell that lands in a mouse muscle tissue, for example, will form a cyst. In this cyst, the single parasite will divide asexually, filling the space with clones of itself. This structure can then remain dormant for the life of the intermediate host.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  The intermediate host mouse may never know it has been infected and has cysts in its muscle tissue. If an uninfected cat eats the mouse muscle tissue containing the cyst, immature <i>T. gondii</i> will burst forth and infect the cat as a new definitive host.
</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Human Exposure to <i>T. Gondii</i></h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  So how does a person become infected with <i>T. gondii</i> and how can it be prevented?
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  The most sensationalized, yet probably the least common source, is directly from your pet cat. The oocysts that are passed in the cat's feces are potentially infectious. Also, oocysts clinging to the cat's paws after it uses the litter box can be deposited on household surfaces. Accidental ingestion can lead to infection. There are a couple of key points to make here. The oocysts are not infectious for at least 24 hours, so daily litter changes are usually enough to eliminate this source. Also, the cat will only shed oocysts for one to two weeks in its entire lifetime. You would have to be very unlucky to coordinate your accidental fecal ingestion with that time period.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  The next source of exposure is by ingesting contaminated soil. Outdoor cats bury their waste and prefer the soft, disturbed soil of gardens and sandboxes. An infected cat can deposit infectious oocysts in these areas, leading to human exposure. This threat can be eliminated by wearing gloves while gardening, washing your hands thoroughly afterwards, and covering sand boxes when they are not in use.
