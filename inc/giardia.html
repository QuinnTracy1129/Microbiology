<h3 style="padding-left: 20px;">What is Giardia? - Causes, Transmission & Symptoms</h3>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  The anaerobic parasite  lamblia is one of the most common intestinal protozoans in the United States. In this lesson, we examine the major characteristics of Giardia and discuss treatment and prevention options.

<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Leeuwenhoek and <i>Giardia</i></h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  <b><i>Giardia lamblia</i></b> is an anaerobic protozoan parasite commonly found in water sources. There are many distinct species of Giardia, usually specific to different species of vertebrates. For this lesson, we will focus on G. lamblia because it is the major species affecting humans and associated mammals.

  <i>Giardia</i> transitions through two life stages: trophozoite and cyst.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  The <b>trophozoite</b> is the actively dividing, vegetative stage of the protozoan. If you look at a Giardia trophozoite through a microscope, several interesting things are visible. First, the trophozoite appears to be looking back at you. Giardia trophozoites are <b>diplomonads</b>, meaning they have two nuclei. The cell is shaped like a teardrop with the two nuclei resembling eyes. At the narrow point of the teardrop, Giardia has several pairs of flagella, which provide motility. On the bottom surface of the cell is a disc-shaped sucker used for attachment. But we'll come back to that in a few minutes.

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  The <i>Giardia</i> <b>cyst</b> is an oval-shaped resistant structure with a very thick wall. These cysts are dormant structures that Giardia uses to survive the harsh aerobic conditions encountered while outside of the host. The cysts are highly resistant to desiccation and chemical disinfection. They are almost completely immune to the effects of chlorine, making them difficult to eradicate from water supplies that use solely chlorine for sanitation.
</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Lifecycle</h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  Let's examine the lifecycle of a typical <i>Giardia</i> cell. We'll start with a beaver swimming around underwater while damming a creek. The beaver invariably swallows some creek water contaminated with <i>Giardia</i> cysts. The cysts are able to pass through the stomach intact, but the low pH initiates excystation, or the process of reactivating from the cyst form. In the duodenum of the small intestine, the trophozoites emerge and multiply very rapidly by binary fission. Those ventral discs come in handy now for attachment to the intestinal walls. Here the trophozoites take in nutrients and divide, releasing many new infectious cysts into the intestinal fluids. These cysts are excreted in the feces of the beaver and can immediately infect a new host.

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  For this example, I used the beaver for a very good reason. The beaver is considered the primary <b>reservoir host</b> of Giardia. A reservoir host is a nonhuman host that serves as a means of sustaining an infectious organism as a potential source of human infection. It makes sense that the beaver, along with the muskrat, would be effective reservoir hosts, as they are both primarily aquatic. These species can be continuously reinfected while shedding cysts. In fact, Giardiasis is often called 'Beaver Fever.' But in actuality, any bird or mammal can play the role of the beaver in the <i>Giardia</i> infection lifecycle.

<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Infection and Prevention</h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  So how do humans acquire <i>Giardia</i> and the associated disease Giardiasis? Drinking contaminated water and the fecal-oral route are the most common pathways of entry. An estimated 97% of surface waters contain cysts, including rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and even swimming pools. Any waterway that is home to animals or contaminated with feces probably contains <i>Giardia</i> cysts.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  Campers are usually considered high-risk because they drink from natural water sources. Children in day care are also considered high-risk because of the high probability of fecal-oral contamination and transmission. There have also been cases of individuals acquiring infections through sexual contact.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  What is the best way to prevent Giardiasis? The number one preventative is to filter, then boil your drinking water. The addition of chemical treatments with iodine and chlorine will further improve sterilization. Also, proper hygiene such as thorough hand-washing can eliminate many of the risks associated with fecal-oral transmission.
