<h3 style="padding-left: 20px;">The Germ Theory of Disease: Definition & Louis Pasteur</h3>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  In this lesson, we will look at one of the most influential experiments in the field of microbiology. We will learn how Louis Pasteur disproved the theory of spontaneous generation which helped lead to the development of the germ theory of disease.

  I want you to try an experiment. This might take a while for results to develop, so be prepared to wait. I want you to buy a nice steak, open it, place it on your kitchen counter, and leave it alone for a week. Don't cover it, cook it, toss it out, or disturb it in any way. Come back in a week so we can discuss the results.

  Unless you live alone, in a house you own, way out in the country, I wouldn't recommend actually doing this experiment. But, let's pretend we did. What kind of observations do you think we could make? First off, the steak probably smells really bad. There are probably flies and maggots crawling all over the surface. There may be rodent droppings and gnaw marks. If you zoomed in on the surface of the meat and examined it under a microscope, you would no doubt see millions of bacterial cells. But where did this massive population of microorganisms come from?

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  For hundreds of years, this question was easy to answer. The organisms formed from the dead meat itself. As in, actually arose from the matter in the meat. This sounds ridiculous now, but this is what people believed for hundreds of years - until Louis Pasteur came along.

<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Spontaneous Generation</h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  In the 1700s and 1800s, variations of this steak experiment were being conducted to prove, or disprove, the theory of spontaneous generation. <b>Spontaneous generation</b> states that living organisms can arise from inanimate, nonliving matter. This was the theory used to explain why food that was left out would eventually be covered in microbes, maggots, flies, and rodents. These organisms were created by, then arose from, the food itself.
</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  In France in 1822, a future scientist was born who would refute the spontaneous generation hypothesis and lay the groundwork for how people would approach medicine and microbiology for generations.

<h4 style="padding-left: 20px;">Louis Pasteur</h4>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-left: 2.5%; margin-right: 5%;">
  Louis Pasteur was a firm believer in biogenesis - the idea that living organisms could only come from other living organisms. Pasteur observed that there were tiny organisms present in the air around us that resembled the tiny organisms present on the putrefying meat. He concluded that the organisms settled out of the air and infected the meat, not that the meat spawned them. Surrounded by doubters, he decided to prove his theory using meat broth.
